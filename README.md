# Fine-grained-Car-Classification-using-Transfer-Learning

This paper is aiming at improving car model classification tasks by evaluating several models to generate a high performance model that is faster and with high accuracy. We compare these results to that of baseline models and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each model. We also try to improve the best model. We use the Stanford Cars Dataset.
